# FINE3300-2025-A1

This project contains Python code for calculating Canadian mortgage payments and performing currency conversions using exchange rate data from the Bank of Canada. It includes two main classes:

- **MortgagePayment** – calculates monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, and accelerated payments.
- **ExchangeRates** – reads a CSV file and converts amounts between USD and CAD.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `main.py` and run it with Python 3.
3. Follow the prompts to choose either the mortgage calculator or currency converter.

## Example Outputs
- Mortgage Payment for $500,000 at 5.5% over 25 years.
- USD ⇄ CAD conversions using the latest Bank of Canada rate.
